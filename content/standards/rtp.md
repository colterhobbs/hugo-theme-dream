At JP Technical, we work hard to build what we call our "Recommended Technology Platform”. We know that using products across this platform will give you a great platform to operate your business from (we know this because we “Eat our own dog food” and use ALL of the services below to run our own company).

Our engineers are trained in and keep up to date with technology across this core set of products to make sure that we can quickly, efficiently and expertly assist you with working with those products.

We also maintain a strong network of contract engineers that we can call on for
specific expertise in high level or advanced customization of these core
services.

## Third Party Vendors

While we are pretty proficient with our troubleshooting skills, and are able to
solve a variety of different technical problems, 3rd party products outside our
Recommended Platform may take us a little extra time to become familiar with
managing and supporting these unfamiliar products.

If the issues can and should be supported by the 3rd party vendor, then we may
help you communicate with the vendor directly to get the problem solved, this is
often the quickest and best solution for you.
