## Networking

### pfSense Routing & Firewall

We recommend the Netgate products. Netgate is the maintainer for pfSense, the
single most popular open-source firewall operating system. pfSense is used in
large enterprises as well as small offices. We have been specializing in
pfSense, and it's predecessor, since 2005. There are no licenses costs,
hardware is easy to find and long-lasting.

- [Netgate 4100 | max througput 1.4 Gbps](https://amzn.to/3GjSwms)

### Unifi Routing and Networking {#unifi}

We have standardized on Unifi for networking gear. However, in recent years
there has been an availability challenge. The following are the parts in our
RTP, or 'Recommended Technology Platform'.

#### Control Plane

> For control over Unifi devices, we have two options, either Hosted by
> JP Technical, or Self-hosted with a cloud key or Unifi Dream Machine
> Router on-premise.

For on-premise hosting:

- [Ubiquiti Networks UniFi Cloud Key Gen2 (UCK-G2)](https://amzn.to/3cvmJTQ)
  - This is a control plane ONLY.
- [Ubiquiti Networks UniFi Dream Machine SE | UDM-SE](https://amzn.to/3CIUN9L)
- [Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine | UDM-US](https://amzn.to/3AWy09i)

#### Routers

  (UXG-PRO)](https://amzn.to/3B4xeqh)
- [Ubiquiti Networks Networks Unifi Security Gateway
  (USG)](https://amzn.to/3KuSdWW)
- Routers for self-managed systems:
  - [Ubiquiti Networks UniFi Dream Machine SE |
    UDM-SE](https://amzn.to/3CIUN9L)
  - [Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine | UDM-US](https://amzn.to/3AWy09i)

> All the following Unifi equipment work either with the on-premise or
> hosted control planes.

#### Switches

  (USW-Flex-Mini)](https://amzn.to/3Q1SFwM)

> The Flex Mini takes special configuration steps, this is not a
> customer-install item.

- [Unmanaged Netgear 5-port PoE](https://amzn.to/3xhqCCW)

  > NOTE: This is not a managed switch, it should not be used in environments with
  > compliance needs.

#### Access Points

We have found this specific Access Point to be the best overall performer.
There are others for special circumstances.

- [Ubiquiti UniFi 6 Pro Access Point (U6-Pro-US)](https://amzn.to/407ITQg)

### TP-Link Omada Routing and Networking {#omada}

We have begun testing recently on the TP-Link Omada hardware. We are still
early in our testing, but the product looks promising as a 'pro-sumer' line.
The following are the parts in our RTP, or 'Recommended Technology Platform'.

#### Control Plane

> For control over Omada devices, we have two options, either a local hardware
> device, or Self-hosted on a server or computer. We recommend the dedicated
> controller.

For on-premise hosting:

- [TP-Link Omada Hardware Controller OC300 (up to 500 devices)](https://amzn.to/3GLjlAr)
- [TP-Link Omada Hardware Controller OC200 (up to 100 devices)](https://amzn.to/3GLjlAr)
  - This is a control plane ONLY.

#### Routers

Currently, we do not recommend TP-Link routing products. We recommend the
pfSense routing product.

> All the following TP-Link equipment work either with the on-premise or
> hosted control planes.

#### Switches

We are still in the evaluation period with these products, but our early
testing has been positive. The items below should cover the typical scenarios
for a small business.

- [TP-Link TL-SG3452P | 48 Port Gigabit L2+ Managed PoE Switch | 48 PoE+ Port @384W, 4 x SFP Slots](https://amzn.to/3MpJFUk)
- [TP-Link TL-SG2428P Jetstream 28-Port Gigabit Smart Switch with 24-Port PoE+, 4 SFP Slots (250 Watt Budget](https://amzn.to/3nUf86x)
- [TP-Link TL-SG2218P | 16 Port Gigabit Smart Managed PoE Switch | 16 PoE+ Ports @150W, 2 SFP Slots](https://amzn.to/3KENPGk)
- [TP-Link 5 Port Gigabit PoE Switch | 4 PoE+ Port @65W](https://amzn.to/40TQ3Yo)
  - This is not compatible with the Omada SDN Controller


#### Access Points

We are still in the evaluation period with these products, but our early
testing has been positive. The items below should cover the typical scenarios
for a small business.

- [TP-Link EAP610 Ultra-Slim w/DC Power | Omada True Wi-Fi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Business Access Point](https://amzn.to/3nQmisP)
  - This is the traditional access point typically mounted to the ceiling for
    the best coverage.
- [TP-Link EAP615-Wall | Omada Business WiFi 6 AX1800 in-Wall Wireless Gigabit Access Point](https://amzn.to/3nLIxQl)
  - POE is required to power this access point.
  - This wall-mount unit will give you coverage without losing a functional ethernet jack. In fact, you gain an extra two ports, one of which passes through the POE.

use, intuitive, and their tech-support is top-notch. You will need to do some
research to determine which features you need most, but any of the models
below would be compatible with the systems we use. If wifi signal doesn't
reach where you want your camera, email us at support@jptechnical.com and we
can figure out what you need to improve signal there.

## Third Party Vendors

While we are pretty proficient with our troubleshooting skills, and are able to
solve a variety of different technical problems, 3rd party products outside our
Recommended Platform may take us a little extra time to become familiar with
managing and supporting these unfamiliar products.

If the issues can and should be supported by the 3rd party vendor, then we may
help you communicate with the vendor directly to get the problem solved, this is
often the quickest and best solution for you.
