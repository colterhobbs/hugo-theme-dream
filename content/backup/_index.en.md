# What Kind of Backup Do You Have?

 Have you assessed your risks, and made sure your backup covers those risks? We would like to help you with that.

## Security Risks Are Still Huge

We take a security-first approach to business continuity, backups, and disaster recovery. Based on the realities of today’s evolving cybersecurity landscape, we assume that data loss will happen, and proactively prepare businesses to manage those incidents with rapid recovery.

> - 78% of IT Service Providers report attacks on their clients.
> - 50% of ransomware demands exceed $50,000.
> - 40% of attacks require > 8 hours to address – typically at a cost of $100-$250/hour.
> - 80% of businesses that pay the ransom suffer a second ransomware attack.
>   IT Service Providers report that ransomware attacks are caused...
>	  - 54% by phishing emails
>	  - 27% by user practices/gullibility
>	  - 26% by lack of cybersecurity training.

Our backup services are integral in disaster recovery and incident response planning because the solution, regardless of how it’s deployed, directly mitigates the likelihood of attack and total cost of recovery.

### BCDR - Backup of Local Servers & Data

Did you know that your backups are a prime target for ransomware; that's right, _**your backups**_ are a target. Modern malware goes after your backups with as much attention as your live data, because if they can get your backups you are going to pay. This means that backup systems have to be *aware of and safeguarded against* ransomware.


Backups that cannot be changed or deleted without checks and balances (if at all)is referred to as **Immuntability**, and our backup appliance service includes this by default, even I can't delete your backups without communication with out upstream provider. This means that the bad guys have no chance of truly holding your data hostage, as long as it is backed up.

**Our on-site backup systems include:**

> - Built-In and Always-On Features
> - Chain-Free Backups
> - Unlimited Storage and Retention
> - AirGap
> - AutoVerify
> - Virtual Office
> - Local Cache
> - Choice and Flexibility
> - BYO Device or Cloud

For clients seeking a traditional backup and disaster recovery (BDR) system, MSPs can offer our service with an appliance. Clients can choose to Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) or purchase or lease appliances from Axcient – as well as Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) or data center or replicate to Axcient’s cloud.

Regardless, recovery speed and responsiveness to ransomware and other cyberthreats is best-in-class. Both deployment options ensure business continuity with a 15-minute recovery point objective (RPO) and less than a 1-hour recovery time objective (RTO).
