{{< faq "WHAT TYPES OF BUSINESSES DO YOU WORK WITH?" >}}
We find that there is a huge gulf between businesses who are too small for the big ‘Contract Only’ MSPs, but need more than the meager skills of the Geek Squad. That is our specialty! Our ideal client size is under 10 users, but we take on one-man shops as well as the occasional 30 man enterprise.

Over the years, we have gained valuable experience with a wide variety of business types. We have had clients in Dental, Medical, Legal, Accounting, Construction, Manufacturing, Health & Fitness, Photography, Sound Studio and other professional fields.

YUP, but don’t feel boxed in. We recognize that contracts aren’t for everybody. We want you to know exactly what you are paying for, so we prefer time and material services. But if you prefer a contract, and you want some predictability in your budgeting, we can accommodate you. {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "WHAT TYPES OF BUSINESSES DO YOU *NOT* &nbsp; WORK WITH?" >}}
I have no desire to be your employee or on-premise IT guy. I know there are lots of great people out there who would love a 9 to 5er, but that’s not me. I also don’t want to work for a customer that is unwilling to do any troubleshooting or simple tasks themselves. If you aren’t willing to unplug and plug something in again, then I am not your guy.
