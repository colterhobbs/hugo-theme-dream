# Windows & APP Updates

Have you ever been afraid to restart, for fear that your computer might be
updating for hours before you can go back to work?

You can gain control of when Windows and other programs updates with our
WatchDog system.

Restarts can be scheduled and done after-hours. Donâ€™t give in to fear.
