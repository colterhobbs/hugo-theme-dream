# User & Device *Does Not Need to be Hard!*

User & Device Management *does not* have to be hard. Imagine, instead, a
complete platform for identity, access, and device management.

JP Technical changes the way IT administrators manage their organizations by
providing a comprehensive and flexible cloud directory platform. From one pane
of glass, manage user identities and resource access, secure Mac, Windows, and
Linux devices, and get a full view of your environment.

We have well established practices for onboarding and offboarding your
employees. We can help you relieve the headaches with services like SSO, MFA
and MDM.
