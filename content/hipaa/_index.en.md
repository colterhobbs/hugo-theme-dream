## JP Technical has undergone an independant verification process for our HIPAA Compliance Measures

The HIPAA Seal of Compliance has become the healthcare industry standard for verification. Federally-mandated HIPAA standards, regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR), are fully addressed and incorporated into an effective, organization-wide compliance program. See the [Compliancy Group Website](https://compliancy-group.com/hipaa-case-studies/) for some reviews.
