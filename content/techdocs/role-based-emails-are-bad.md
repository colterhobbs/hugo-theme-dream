Email deliverability is of critical importance because you get to ensure that you send your emails to their intended audience. Deliverability can be affected by a number of factors. Let's talk about one common factor, Role-based Email Addresses.

## What is a Role-based Email Address?
- Role addresses are organizational email addresses **associated with a certain function, responsibility, position or department and not with an individual**.
- They are mostly managed by more than one individual and mostly have a distribution list. That means the email sent to a role address actually will be shared with everyone on the distribution list.
- Also known as role-based email addresses or role email addresses, role addresses are different from other email addresses in that they do not represent a specific individual. Addresses like support@ , info@ or hiring@ are examples of role addresses. They’re often broadcast or redistributed to a number of individuals.

## Problems associated with role-addresses

- You’ll face a higher bounce rate
- You could be blacklisted
- You fall short of compliance
- Your risks are disproportionate

Here is a great, and brief, [article](https://www.warmupinbox.com/generic-vs-role-based-emails) on the risks of a role-based email address. We always recommend named users, and sparing use of a Group (collaborative inbox) for these role-based addresses. A role-based email should NEVER be an individual's private email address.
