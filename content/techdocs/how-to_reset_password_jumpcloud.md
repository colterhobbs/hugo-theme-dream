Here's a [quick video on how to reset your password with JumpCloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbvbPHSOL6c).

1. First go to [console.jumpcloud.com](https://console.jumpcloud.com) and then
   log in as the newly created user.
2. Now that we've logged in, we'll go to the security menu on the left.
3. Now click the *Reset password* link.
4. Then, click the button *I don't see the app*.
5. Type in the current password.
6. Type in the new password.
7. And then click the *update password* button.

That will reset the user's password.
