{{< faq "WHAT TYPES OF BUSINESSES DO YOU WORK WITH?" >}}
We find that there is a huge gulf between businesses who are too small for the big service companies, but need more than the meager skills of the Geek Squad. That is our specialty!

Our ideal client size is around 10-20 people. I understand the challenges of a one-man shop; although we do have minimums I think we can definitely help. We do have 60+ person small enterprises we support with great success.

Over the years, we have gained valuable experience with a wide variety of business types. We have had clients in Dental, Medical, Legal, Accounting, Construction, Manufacturing, Health & Fitness, Photography, Sound Studio and other professional fields.

{{< faq "DO YOU SUPPORT WORK FROM HOME?" >}}
Work from home is our jam! We have been fully remote workers since out start in 2002, and we have been fully using the cloud since 2007.

When the local restrictions came down forcing many businesses to support remote workers, our biggest challenge was just finding Webcams and Headsets; but our clients were already prepared to work from home. Work-from-home is a piece-of-cake, and we can help you feel as good about it as we do.

{{< faq "DO YOU OFFER CONTRACT SERVICES?" >}}
YUP! We have learned from more than 20 years in the business that we can provide the best possible service when we have clear and well defined expectations. Our most popular management agreements include **_UNLIMITED_** support services. We like to give you very predictable monthly IT costs, and this allows us to give awesome service.
