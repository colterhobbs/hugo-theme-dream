<h2>Advanced Threat Protection with Huntress EDR</h2>
<p>At JP Technical, we take your cybersecurity seriously. That’s why we use Huntress, one of the most trusted names in Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), to protect your systems around the clock.<p>
<br>

<h2>What Huntress Does</h2>
Huntress constantly monitors your computers and servers for signs of malicious activity — things like ransomware, backdoors, and suspicious software that traditional antivirus often misses. When something unusual is detected, the Huntress platform alerts our team immediately and provides detailed, actionable insights to help us respond quickly and effectively.

<br>
<br>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Modern cyber threats don’t always show up as viruses. Hackers use clever tactics to sneak in and stay hidden — sometimes for weeks or months. Huntress is built to spot these hidden threats early and give us the tools to shut them down before they become a serious problem.<p>
<br>

<h2>Behind-the-Scenes Experts</h2>
<p>What makes Huntress even more powerful is the team behind it. Security analysts — real people, not just algorithms — review suspicious activity and help confirm whether something’s a real threat. That human intelligence makes a big difference in catching things early and avoiding false alarms.<p>
<br>

<h2>Peace of Mind, Built In.</h2>
<p>With Huntress and JP Technical on your side, you’re not just getting alerts — you’re getting a partner who actively works to keep your business safe.</p>
