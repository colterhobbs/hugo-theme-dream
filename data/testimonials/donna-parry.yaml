text: "It has been a great comfort knowing that someone that knows what they are doing is watching our computers. One of our 4 computers has been restarting... JP explained what the alert meant and -- he told me how to fix it --. Wow, I knew in advance BEFORE my computer crashed! It was really cool, and since there was no actual crash, it saved me time and money."
